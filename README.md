April 20, version 2.0 updated some current issues:
1. Delete the region settings and only keep the currency switching function.
2. Change the Chinese interface to English interface.
3. Change the holiday information from fixed sample data to dynamic acquisition based on the current date.
4. The transaction category is changed from Chinese to English hard-coded format, eliminating the bug that AI will reply in Chinese.
5. The predefined data of AI suggestion response is changed to be based on actual holiday information and transaction data.
6. Optimize the current UI interface, add dynamic effects, and delete redundant panel code files.
